                        man from a simple and humble family, born in Cairo.
                        Al-Zero was born in 1984 AD, and Al-Zero studied in public schools in his hometown, and he was
                        an outstanding student from a young age.
                        He was also very fond of and attached to the field of professional digital games, as well as the
                        famous Atari game at that time.
                        In the secondary school, computers appeared for the first time, and this boy attracted the
                        attention of him, and he had computer experience and was working on DOS systems.
                        Therefore, he wanted to complete his university studies in the field of computers, but the costs
                        of the university at that time were too high for him to bear.
                        Therefore, he decided to join a study institute, and indeed he joined the Institute of Social
                        Work, but after graduating from the institute, he never worked in his field.
                        Rather, he focused his attention on learning and studying his field of passion, which is
                        computer science, to start his scientific career in the field of programming.
                        He embarked on a long journey in the field of computers and programming until he became a
                        distinctive mark in the Arab world and a role model for all young people who want to learn
                        programming.
                        Despite the obstacles represented by the lack of educational and material resources, he was able
                        to pass by placing the banner of glory on the top of the mountain.
                        It also proved to the entire world its ability to achieve success and even to reach excellence
                        even without postgraduate degrees and studies.
